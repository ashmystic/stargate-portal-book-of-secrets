# stargate-portal-book-of-secrets

This interactive widget is a simulation of a stargate portal that is a component of a 3D diorama art project. The Stargate Portal will be displayed on a phone (currently sized for a 1st-gen iPhone SE) that will then be surrounded by cardboard and paper to give the effect of a real stargate. The project is currently in development.
